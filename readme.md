## About the Project 

**Summary**   
Cash for Trash is a website to encourage users to recycle their unwanted items by bringing their waste to selected stations in exchange for cash. The website is to introduce users to recycling as well as the basic materials which can be recycled. It also includes as its main feature the locations    
of the nearest Cash for Trash stations. 

Many consumers have the habit of throwing away unwanted items due to the desire to declutter or due to lack of space in the place that they are living in. As a result, a lot of unnecessary waste is created, especially since many companies generally come up with new products or new models to generate sales from the same customer group. The goal of this project is to educate the user to consider recycling as another means of disposal of their unwanted items, as opposed to mere discarding of their unwanted waste.

**User Goal**   
 The pain points of a consumer include time taken to look for a recycling station as well as locating the nearest MRT station location of the recying station. It also includes know what type of material or object is suitable for recyling. So, the goal of the user is to have a website where they are able to find nearby recycling stations as well as to determine the nearest mrt station. 

 **Organization Goal**   
 The goal of the organization is to create awareness to the user by providing user with three layers of information: Why recycle, How to recycle and where to recycle. The goal of the organization is to solve the pain point of the user, so the information related to where to the question of where to recycle is the highlight of the website. 

**Rationale of Project**
The website will allow for easy access to locations of recycling stations as well as mrt stations. It will also be able contain relevant informaiton for the user to access in relation to recycling.
